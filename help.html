          <h4>1. Registration</h4>
          <p>As you can see you didn't have to create a new account and fill any confusing forms in order to create your profile. Instead you had to log in with your google Account. That's because all WE need from you is your email.</p>
                    <h4>2. Tags</h4>
          <p>This site provides anonymity in order to make equal grounds for everyone, no matter your gender, ethnicity, religion or looks. </p>

          <h4>3. How does it work then?</h4>
          <p>You create your own CV adding tags that you think describe the best your professional abilities. Add what you specialize in and tell us something about you! Are you a <button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-danger">individualist</button> or a <button type="button" class="btn btn-xs btn-danger">teamworker</button> ?
</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">

          <h4>4.What now?</h4>
          <p>Now you wait for a match! A company will create their own tags that decrease the pound of their future potential employees. Once they are satisfied in the number of matches they will send a mail with a quizz that will give you an opportunity to tell them more about yourself and your experiences.</p>

          <h4>5. Now you wait.</h4>
          <p>Once you complete the quizz you wait for the answer! If you are the one they are looking for they will ask you for an interview, or maybe a career portfolio. It's up to them.</p>
